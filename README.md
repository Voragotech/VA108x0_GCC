# VA108x0_GCC
Documentation and example GCC projects 

This repository holds an application note and sample GCC based projects for the VA108x0 MCUs from Vorago.  

One project is the basic, obligatory "blink LED" project.  

The second project is the full REB1 evaluation board project.  

It is highly recommended to peruse the application note even if you are an experienced GCC / GDB developer.
